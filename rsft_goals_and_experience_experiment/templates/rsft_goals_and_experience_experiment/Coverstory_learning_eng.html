  Instructions Learning Phase
{% endblock %}


{% block content %}
  <p>This page explains what you do before the choice phase begins. You will see two options, both options offer points with some probability. You see the amount of points (e.g., 5 points and 7 points), but you will not see the probabilities. Each amount of points occurs with some constant probability (e.g., 5 points 80% of the time, 7 points 20%). <b>Your task in the learning phase is to learn about the hidden probabilities.</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>To learn about the probabilities you can click on the options. Clicking causes the option to play out a point draw according to the option's hidden probabilities and to show you the drawn amount of points. E.g., 5 points will appear in 80 of 100 clicks if the hidden probability is 80%. You can click both options until you have learned the probabilities.</p>

  <p>You can move on at any time. Once you feel you have learned the probabilities of both options you can continue to the choice phase by clicking on the “I am ready to move on” button.</p>

  <p>The maximum number of clicks available to you equals in total {{ num_samples }}, counting clicks on both options together.</p>

  <p>After you have moved on, the choice phase starts, and then a new block starts. New blocks reset the click counter and give you another {{ num_samples }} clicks to learn about the hidden probabilities</p>

  {% if goal_condition == 1 %}
    <p>Above the options you see a text that informs you about the threshold you will have to reach or exceed in phase 2, the threshold will be explained on the next page.</p>
