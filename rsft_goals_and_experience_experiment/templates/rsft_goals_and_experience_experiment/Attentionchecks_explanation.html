  <p>Next you will decide repeatedly between two options. There will be a total of 15 blocks and each block begins with a learning phase followed by a choice phase, which will be explained to you after this page.</p>

If you answer more than 50% of those attention checks incorrectly, we have to assume you failed to pay attention and can only pay 50% of the payment. By selecting "I have understood this" you acknowledge that this might impact your payment.</p>
